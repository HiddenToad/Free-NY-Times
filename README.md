just run the executable its very easy

if macos complains about it being from an unidentified dev then just open settings > security and privacy > general and there'll be a thing on the bottom that says "open anyway" so just click that

if you want to run the script instead of the executable, download the shellscript, open a terminal, and type "bash FreeNYTimes.sh"

mac only
